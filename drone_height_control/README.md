# Drone Height Control
Drone height control.m file is single matlab file which has drone 1d dynamics and control algorithm. This single matlab file was created to reduce the complexity and for easy understanding.
## Dynamics
Using newton's second law the drone 1-D equation of motion of the drone
$$ F = F_{thrust}-F_{drag}-F_{gravity} $$
