# Drone Height Control

The `Drone_height_control.m` file is a comprehensive MATLAB script that contains the altitude dynamics of a drone with a control algorithm. The `Drone_height_control.m` file combines everything into one script to make it easier to understand and reduce errors.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** To provide a straightforward implementation of drone height control using MATLAB.
- **Components:** 
  - ### Dynamics
    Using newton's second law the drone 1-D equation of motion of the drone
    - $` F = F_{control}-F_{gravity} `$
    - $` ma_{z} = F_{control} -mg `$
  - ### Control algorithm

## Features

- Single-file implementation to reduce complexity
- Easy to read and understand
- Contains both the dynamics and control logic for height control

## Usage
